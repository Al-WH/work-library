\section{Introduction}
    This document describes the development model and the development plan for !!NAME!!, 
    which will be a system for time reporting and is based on \textit{Baseblock System}.
    !!NAME!! will be developed by students at LTH in the course 
    \textit{ETSF20 Programvaruutveckling för stora projekt}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Baseblock system,  this is the base system that is used in !!NAME!!.
        \item \href{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/index.html}{The Java Language Specification}, describes the code convetion that is followed in this project.
        \item \label{PH} Project Tutorial, contains all details of how the project is structured.
        \item CML, consists of all configuration units in the project.

\section{Development Model} %Assar och Victor
    The development model that is used in this project is the waterfall model. This
    means that the project is divided into four seperate phases where each phase depends
    on the previous one in a sequential manner. It is thus required that a phase is
    completed before the next one begins.
    \\ \\
    In every phase, there are several documents that must be produced (see table \ref{documenttable}) and a phase
    is considered completed only once all documents required in the phase has reached baseline.
    To reach baseline, all documents of the phase must first pass an informal review, 
    followed by a formal review. This process and its details is further described in section \ref{followup}.
    
\section{Staff Organisation} %Assar
    The group consists of 21 members that have been divided into 4 main groups, with 2 extra groups consisting of members from several groups.

    \noindent
    \\
    On Tuesdays there are Project group Meetings\label{PM}, which are mandatory for every member in the group.
    On these meetings the project is discussed and general decisions can be taken. This is an important step in the development model, to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the time plan is being kept.
    
    \subsection{Estimated Work Load}
        PG holds one hour long meeting every week and has scheduled for a two hour time slot every wednesday where every group works on their respective task. To supplement this, the groups are expected to hold their own planing meetings and work sessions. Since the workload of each group varies between phases, it seemed more fitting to allow groups the flexibility of managing their own time. Group leaders have been tasked with making sure that coordination between groups is constant throughout the project. PG also estimated that approximately an hour every week will be spent on general discussions in the discord channel.
        \\ \\
        Table \ref{phasetable} illustrates the estimated start and end dates 
        for every phase, as well as estimated hours spent per week, per person.

\section{Standards \& Tools}    % Victor
    In order to make the development process as easy and straight forward as possible,
    the project group has agreed on several standards and tools to use. 
    \\ \\
    The standards should be followed by every group member and consists of the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The source code should follow the The Java Language Specification.
        \item All comments, commits and pull-requests should be in english.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Discord}
    Discord is used as the many communcation tool in the group. A server has been setup and is
    used for both messaging, working together and having project meetings.
    The server consistst of several voice channels and several text channels, each
    with its specific purpose, eg \textit{Meetings} or \textit{Developer Group}.
    
    \subsection{Github \& Git}
    Git is used for collaboration between decouments and the project library (see \ref{project_library})
    and is hosted on Github. Git provides abilities that  makes certain action very
    easy, such as pulling and pushing updates to the working repository and creating pull-requests for merging.
    
    \subsection{Eclipse}
        Eclipse is the primary IDE that is used due to its familarity in
        the group and its huge span of different properties such as plugins.
    
        \subsubsection{Egit}
            Egit is a plugin for Eclipse that provides the tools needed for a git workflow 
            in Eclipse IDE.
            
        \subsubsection{Texmaker}
            Texmaker is a latex edtior that provides the tools needed to compile and preview latex files.
    
\section{Follow up and Quality Evaluation \label{followup}}
    To keep the quality of all documents as high as possible during the project,
    two reviews will be carried out at the end of every phase. One \textit{informal review}
    followed by one \textit{formal review}.

    \subsection{Informal Review \label{informalreview}}
        The informal review is performed within the project group and is meant to catch
        errors, bugs or mistakes in the documents. This is to ensure as high quality
        as possible for the formal review. The result of the review is \emph{not} pass or
        not pass, but its purpose is rather to improve the documents.
        \\ \\
        The informal review is carried out at least 3 days before the formal review and the documents that
        shall be reviewed should ready at latest 17:00 the day before the review.    PG is responsible
        for coordinating the meetings as well as documenting them.
        There are at least three reviewers assigned for each document to be reviewed, and these
        are assigned by PG. During the review the reviewers will mention and discuss what they have
        found and then the reviewees will get an opportunity to reply and have a potential discussion
        if needed. A detailed guide for the informal reviews are found in the IRP. 
        \\ \\
        To emphasize, the informal review is \emph{not} ment to criticize or judge, but rather
        to make the documents as good as possible. 
        
    
    \subsection{Formal Review \label{formalreview}}
        After the documents have gone through the informal review, they must pass the formal review
        to reach baseline. During the formal review, and extern reviewer is
        given the documents at least 48 hours in advance so that he or she can prepare.
        During the actual review, the entire project group shall be present.
        The formal review can result in one of the four scenarios:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The documents are approved.
            \item The documents are approved after certain modification.
            \item Modifications must be made followed by a re-review.
            \item The documents are \emph{not} approved and must be re-written,
                    followed by a new review.
        \end{enumerate}
    
    \subsection{Re-Review}
        In case the documents fail the formal review, it might be necessary to
        to do a new review after certain modifications have been made.
            
    \subsection{Following the Timeplan}
        If the project is unable to follow timeplan for some reason, the following procedure is taken:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Identify the problem} - This is the most critical step of the            procedure because the cause could be anything from a bad timeplan to
                    members of the team being sick and unable to work.
            \item \textbf{Explore possible solutions} - Depending on what kind of problem it is, there might be several different solutions and this makes it important to identify and weigh the different ones.
            \item \textbf{Pick a solution}. 
            \item \textbf{Take an action}. 
            \item \textbf{Prevent the problem from happening again} - 
                    To prevent the problem from happening again, there must be some
                    type of follow-up routine. Depending on what the problem scenario is,
                    this follow-up could be a personal meeting between PG and the persons
                    involved, or re-creating a timeplan using a different technique.
                    The take-away here is to note the problem, the action and its
                    result, so that the experience can be used in the future to prevent
                    the same problem from occuring again.
        \end{enumerate}

\section{Configuration Managment}   % Victor
    All changes to units in the CML must follow a certain procedure once the documents
    have reached baseline. Git and Github are the main tools that are used to handle configuration management in this project.

    \subsection{Project Library \label{project_library}}
        The project library consists of two seperate libraries: Document libray and Work library.
    
        \subsubsection{Document Library \label{doclibrary}}
            The document library consists of the following:
            
            \begin{itemize}
                \item All configuration units that have reached baseline.
                \item All documents that invloves version control and change management (see                       section \ref{versioncontrol}).
                \item Protocols from informal reviews (see section \ref{informalreview}).
                \item Protocols from formal reviews (see section \ref{formalreview}).
                \item Protocols and agendas from Project Group Meetings (see section \ref{PM}).
            \end{itemize}
            \noindent
            The purpose of this library is that the customer or a reviewer at any point should be able to access these documents. 
            This means that this library is initially almost empty, and documents are added as the project proceeds. In the end of phase 4, all units listed in CML can be found in this library.

            
        \subsubsection{Work Library}
            The work library contains everything all files that are required during the project.
            The library is divided into three different branches where each branch has its unique purpose.
            
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \begin{verbatim} development \end{verbatim}
                This branch is where the all development is done and is used as a placement for all files related
                to the project, regardless of their status.
                Every member in the group has free push access to this branch.
                
                \item \begin{verbatim} review \end{verbatim}
                Once the documents in the development branch are ready for an informal review,  they are moved
                into the \textit{review} branch. This requires a pull-request to be made, which must be reviewed and accepted by ECG before it is merged into the branch. 
                
                \item \begin{verbatim} master \end{verbatim}
                Once the documents pass the formal reviews, they are merged into 
                \textit{master} branch, which consists of only files that have reached baseline.
                Once new documents are added to this branch, they are also placed in the document library (see section \ref{doclibrary}).
                Note that not all files are copied to the document library, but only the documents specified in the CML.
                
            \end{itemize}
            
            \begin{figure}[h]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/workflow.png}
                \caption{Workflow of the three branches.}
                \label{workflow}
            \end{figure}
        
    \subsection{Version Control \label{versioncontrol}}
        Before a configuration unit has reached baseline, changes to the unit
        may occur freely, without any restrictions.
        However, once a configuration unit has reached baseline there are several steps
        that must be taken in order to make changes to it.
        These steps consists of the following:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Creating a error report that states what the
                    error is with the unit, in its current state.
            \item The error report is handed to the ECG who then decides if the error is              legitimate.
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item If the error is deemed legitimate, then they
                    propose a solution and
                    decides whom shall be responsible to fix the problem.
                    Once the error is corrected, ECG must approve it
                    and then the version number for the unit must be updated.
                    \item If ECG decides that the error is to be discarded.
                \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
        Exact details of this procedure can be found in the Project Tutorial (see section \ref{PH}).

    \subsection{Version Naming \& Update}
        The version number is in the format of $X.Y$ where $X$ refers to the baseline
        of the unit (in this project, $X$ will be either $0$ or $1$). $Y$ refers
        to which version at the given baseline.
        \\ \\
        How the version number is decided depends if the unit has reached baseline or not.
        \begin{table}[h]
            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
                \hline
                    \textbf{Baseline} & \textbf{How $Y$ is decided.} \\
                \hline
                    Before & \parbox{.8\textwidth} { \vspace{.2cm}
                            Once a unit has been created, the $Y$
                            starts at 1, which results in version $0.1$. When the unit is ready for informal
                            review, the $Y$ is incremented to 2. Then, the $Y$ is incremented once, for every change to the unit until it passes a formal review. This means that before reaching baseline, a unit will have a version of at least $0.2$.
                            \vspace{.2cm} } \\
                \hline
                    After & \parbox{.8\textwidth} { \vspace{.2cm}
                        If and only if the procedure described in \ref{versioncontrol}, when a document has reached baseline, results in a modification of the
                        configuration unit, the $Y$ is incremented. This means that
                        it is significantly harder to modify a configration unit once
                        is has reached baseline. This should make sense because units
                        that has reached baseline has passed formal reviews, which means
                        that they can be seen as valid and reliable.
                        \vspace{.2cm}} \\
                \hline
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{How the $Y$ in $X.Y$ is decided in the version numbering}
            \label{versionnumber}
        \end{table}

\section{Rules and Guidelines} %Assar
    To ensure clear communcation and efficiency PG has set up a series of rules and guidelines. If these rules are not followed, there will be a meeting with the involved parties to determine cause and future actions. 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{React to information} - Discord has a feature that allows users to react to messages with an emoji. This is a good way to let the sender know that their message has been acknowledged.
        \item \textbf{Mandatory attendance for group meetings and work sessions} - If a group member is unable to attend a meeting they are expected to contact PG and get the information another way.  
        \item \textbf{Weekly time report in epuss every Friday 17:00}
        \item \textbf{Official project language is English}
        \item \textbf{Be on time}
    \end{itemize}
