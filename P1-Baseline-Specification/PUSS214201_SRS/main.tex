\section{Introduction}

This document presents requirements for the (Sätt in namn). (Sätt in namn) is a system which purpose and main functionality is to administer time reporting with web-usage capabilities. 


\section{Reference documents}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Software Requirements Specification: BaseBlockSystem, v. 1.0, Doc. number: PUSS12002
  \item The requirements on the usability of the system applies to this document and are therefore implemented in “System-namn”, following requirements are implemented; 6.1.1, 6.1.2, 6.1.3, 6.1.4, 6.1.6, 6.1.8, 6.1.9, 6.2.2
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background and goals}
\subsection{Main goals}

The goal is to develop and distribute a web-based system where the user can report time and administrate the system according to their roles.

\subsection{Actors and their objectives}
The system can be used and administrated by following actors;

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{User:} The user has the authority to log in to the system to report and  change past reported time as well as review their reported times. The user also inherits roles as either "SG", "UG", and "TG".
  \item \textbf{Project Leader:}
  The project leaders main objective is to administer groups within the project, this implies that the project leader has the authority to add and remove as well as assign users from/to designated roles.
   \item \textbf{Administrator:} The administrator has the authority to add and remove users from the system along with creating and removing project groups. The admin is the only role that can assign the role “Project leader” to a user. The main goal of this role is to be able to administrate creation and removal of users.
\end{itemize}
